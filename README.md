# lsftop
Do you love htop? Do you love, or at least love to hate, LSF? Well right now this tool doesn't really do anything useful to help you with that! But the idea is to create an LSF monitor using perl and ncurses that provides a generic htop-like interface to LSF.

# General Goal
In htop the top pane shows usage of each core, and the bottom pane shows processes. For lsftop the top pane will show LSF status information (exact information TBD) and the bottom pane will show job information.
